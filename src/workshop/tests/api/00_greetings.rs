//! Welcome to the workshop! ðŸ‘‹
//! You will learn how to write Rust HTTP API. ðŸ¦€
//!
//! The material is structured as a series of exercises.

/// This is your first exercise! ðŸ¤“
/// In this case, the test contains a `todo!()`.
/// To make the test pass, you are expected to replace these todos with working code.
/// Be aware, sometimes a one-liner won't be enough!
///
/// Now:
/// - Open your terminal
/// - cd into the `src/workshop` directory
/// - Solve the exercise
/// - Run `cargo test` to check if tests pass or not.
/// - Comment out the next module in the `src/workshop/tests/api/main.rs` files to progress.
#[test]

    let i_am_ready_to_start = todo!();
