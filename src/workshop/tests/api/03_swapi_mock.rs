//! You are able to retrieve the height from Swapi, great!
//! However a docker image of the service you are working with
//! is not always available.
//! In these cases you can write a mock, i.e. a piece of software
//! that mimics like the service you are calling.
//! Let's practice writing a mock using the
//! [wiremock](https://docs.rs/wiremock/) library!
//!
//! ðŸ’¡ This test should pass even if you stop the swapi container!
