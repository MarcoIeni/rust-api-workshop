/// ## Useful resources ðŸ“š
/// - [Swapi docs](https://swapi.dev/documentation)
/// - [Rust HTTP client](https://docs.rs/reqwest/)
///
/// ## Hint 1 ðŸ’¡
/// Always focus on making the test compile and pass first by mocking your functions.
/// For example, `people_by_name` could just return the expected `Person` struct, without doing any network call at first.
/// Please make sure to use `reqwest` to create the HTTP client and retrieve
/// Luke's height before jumping to the next test.
///
/// ## Hint 2 ðŸ’¡
/// This test doesn't have `todo!()`, so you don't have to edit it to make it pass.
